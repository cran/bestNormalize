#' bestNormalize: Flexibly calculate the best normalizing transformation for a
#' vector
#' 
#' The \code{bestNormalize} package provides several normalizing transformations, and introduces a
#' new transformation based off of the order statistics, \code{orderNorm}.
#' Perhaps the most useful function is \code{bestNormalize}, which attempts all
#' of these transformations and picks the best one based off of a goodness of
#' fit statistic.
